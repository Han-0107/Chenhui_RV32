## About Chenhui

The Chenhui core has been tested by Modelsim and real FPGA, and its LDPC codec function has also been tested in real scenarios. The core has a **five-level pipeline** structure, which solves all the hazards caused by the pipeline. Through verilator, you can access C programs for more flexible verification, such as running Super Mario, PAL and other programs, see https://ysyx.oscc.cc/ and https://github.com/Han-0107/ysyx_workbench_hyh in detail.

At the same time, Chenhui also has LDPC functions. I co-tested this functionality with FPGAs, and users can autonomically integrate LDPC functionality into Chenhui with custom instructions, although the RISC-V compiler is not supported.

## Computing Result

Based on verilator, Chenhui can even compute several games, such as PAL (仙剑奇侠传) and Super Mario.
